# 🧱 Project 1: Piston Head Structural Analysis (ANSYS)

This project demonstrates a **static structural analysis** of a piston head using **ANSYS Workbench**. The goal is to evaluate how the piston responds to internal combustion pressure, and to identify areas with high stress and deformation.

## 🔍 Objective

To simulate and understand the mechanical behavior of a piston under high internal pressure, typically caused by combustion inside an engine cylinder.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Software

- **ANSYS Workbench**
- Static Structural Module
- Geometry and Meshing Tools (ANSYS DesignModeler / SpaceClaim)

---

## 🧪 Simulation Details

- **Geometry:** 3D model of a piston head
- **Material:** (Typically Aluminum Alloy or Steel – depending on design)
- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - Fixed supports at the piston pin area or side walls
  - Internal pressure applied on the piston crown
- **Meshing:** Fine mesh around stress-concentration regions for accuracy

---

## 📊 Results & Interpretation

1. **Total Deformation:**  
   - Displays how much the piston crown deforms under applied pressure.
   - Max deformation typically occurs at the center of the piston head.

2. **Equivalent (von Mises) Stress:**  
   - Identifies regions with maximum stress.
   - Useful for determining whether the material would yield under the given load.

3. **Strain Distribution:**  
   - Shows how the material stretches or compresses during the simulation.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Stress concentrations often appear near corners, fillets, or around the piston pin region.
- If von Mises stress exceeds the yield strength of the material, the design needs to be improved.
- Results guide design optimization for durability and performance.
