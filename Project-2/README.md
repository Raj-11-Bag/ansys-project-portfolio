# 🔥 Project 2: Exhaust Manifold Flow & Thermal Analysis (ANSYS Fluent)

This project demonstrates a **Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT)** simulation of an automotive exhaust manifold using **ANSYS Fluent**. The goal is to analyze both fluid flow and heat transfer between the hot exhaust gases and the metal walls of the manifold.

## 🛠️ Tools & Software

- **ANSYS Workbench**
- **ANSYS Fluent (CFD Module)**
- Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) Modeling

## 🧪 Simulation Details

- **Geometry:** Multi-inlet exhaust manifold leading to a single outlet
- **Fluid Domain:** Exhaust gases
- **Solid Domain:** Manifold walls (typically steel or cast iron)
- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - High-temperature gas inlet (~800–1000°C)
  - Outlet with pressure or mass flow condition
  - Conjugate interface between fluid and solid domains
- **Meshing:**
  - Separate fluid and solid meshes
  - Inflation layers for resolving near-wall heat transfer

## 📊 Results & Interpretation

1. **Velocity Contours:**
   - Show the speed of exhaust gases through different runners and collector
   - Reveal areas of recirculation or uneven flow

2. **Pressure Drop:**
   - Important for engine performance and backpressure estimation

3. **Temperature Distribution (Fluid + Solid):**
   - Identify thermal hotspots within the gas and manifold walls
   - Critical for fatigue analysis and thermal management

4. **Heat Flux:**
   - Illustrates the rate of heat transfer across the manifold wall
   - Helps determine cooling or insulation requirements

## 📈 Key Insights

- Non-uniform flow from inlets can create localized overheating
- Heat accumulation at junctions and bends is critical for thermal fatigue
- Temperature gradients across the solid domain guide material selection and design tweaks
