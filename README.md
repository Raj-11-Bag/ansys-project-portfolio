## ðŸ”§ Project 1: Structural Analysis of a Bridge Beam

ðŸŽ¥ **Watch the video:** [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/v-5E2nbXJcM)

**Overview:**
- Simulated stress distribution and deformation in a bridge beam.
- Applied boundary conditions, loads, and material properties.
- Evaluated structural performance under varying load scenarios.
