# ANSYS Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my ANSYS portfolio! This repository showcases two of my simulation-based projects where I used ANSYS to model, analyze, and visualize real-world mechanical and fluid systems.

## 🔧 Project 1: Piston Head Structural Analysis

🎥 **Watch the video:** [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/v-5E2nbXJcM)

**Overview:**
This project involves conducting a static structural simulation of a piston head using ANSYS Workbench. A pressure load is applied to replicate combustion forces, and supports are defined to constrain piston movement. Results include:
- Total deformation contours, showing how the piston crown distorts under load.
- Von Mises stress distribution, identifying potential stress concentrations and regions at risk of yielding.
The output helps assess whether the piston meets mechanical safety criteria under operating pressures.

## 🌊 Project 2: Exhaust Manifold Flow & Thermal Analysis

🎥 **Watch the video:** [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/I5fgQbQvRbM)

**Overview:**
Conducted a CFD-based conjugate heat transfer simulation on an exhaust manifold using ANSYS Fluent. Results include 
- Flow uniformity, pressure drop, heat flux, and thermal distribution Crucial for understanding thermal loading, optimizing material selection, and improving design.
- Simulated high-temperature gas flow through multiple inlet runners converging into a collector. Evaluated velocity, pressure, and temperature fields in both fluid and solid domains.
