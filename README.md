# ANSYS Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my ANSYS portfolio! This repository showcases two of my simulation-based projects where I used ANSYS to model, analyze, and visualize real-world mechanical and fluid systems.

## ðŸ”§ Project 1: Piston Head Structural Analysis

ðŸŽ¥ **Watch the video:** [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/v-5E2nbXJcM)

**Overview:**
This project involves conducting a static structural simulation of a piston head using ANSYS Workbench. A pressure load is applied to replicate combustion forces, and supports are defined to constrain piston movement. Results include:
- Total deformation contours, showing how the piston crown distorts under load.
- Vonâ€¯Mises stress distribution, identifying potential stress concentrations and regions at risk of yielding.
The output helps assess whether the piston meets mechanical safety criteria under operating pressures.

**Overview:**
- Simulated airflow around a car body using ANSYS Fluent.
- Visualized pressure and velocity contours.
- Analyzed aerodynamic behavior and drag forces.
